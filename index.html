      <p  id="fade0start">When they pull up to Rose L. Hardy Middle School, the street is quiet. Just 30 minutes earlier, the block was bustling with students. India dashes out of the car, late once again for her first class.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Hardy is in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, DC, 10 miles from India’s home in Deanwood, in the northeast area of the city. During rush hour, driving from the eastern to the western edge of the city can take Vanessa and India between 45 minutes and 1.5 hours. DC doesn’t provide school buses (except for students with special needs), so many students commute by car or public transportation.</p>

      <p>DC is one of many cities that have expanded school choice options in recent years, through policies such as inter-and intradistrict choice, the growth of charter schools, and tax credit scholarships or vouchers for private schools.</p>
      <br>
      <p  id="fade1end">In DC, all students can enter a lottery to go to the public school of their choice, regardless of whether it’s their neighborhood school. DC also has a robust charter school system, along with a means-tested private-school voucher program for low-income families.</p>
      <br>
      <p>But new choices can also mean trade-offs for families, and the school that best meets a family's needs might be on the other side of town.</p>
      <br>
      <p id="fade2start">Cities have tried to address this transportation issue in different ways. DC gives students the DC One card through the <a href="https://ddot.dc.gov/page/school-transit-subsidy-program" target="_blank">Kids Ride Free program</a>, which allows students in DC schools to travel to and from school for free. Other cities, like New Orleans and New York, offer yellow buses for certain age groups and school types.</p>

      </div>
      <p id="fade4start">Skyler leaves her house around 7:30 every morning, walks down the block to the bus stop, and waits for the H1 bus. The H1 is crowded with professionals on their way to work and almost no other kids, but Skyler likes the quiet atmosphere. </p>

      <br>

      <p id="fade4end">Driving both kids to school would take over an hour, and Sulee has to drive an hour in the other direction to her office in Baltimore. She said some parents worry about their children taking the public bus, but for her, the benefits outweigh the risks. “It gives the kids a sense of pride and independence to be able to get around the city themselves,” she said. </p>
      <br>
      <p>It helps, of course, that Skyler is in high school. For elementary school students, riding the bus or Metro alone might not be the best option, even if it is the quickest way to school.</p>
      <br>
      <p id="fade5start">Amy Quinn, cofounder and director of teaching and learning at Washington Yu Ying Public Charter School in DC, said the elementary school works closely with students and families facing long commutes to try to make the start of their day less chaotic. “Besides just being late, commutes can cause stress that comes out in academics, because it comes out in behavior,” she said. </p>
      <br>
      <p id="fade5end">Some tactics to help students include providing breakfast in their first class and giving them a few minutes to settle in before jumping into schoolwork.</p> 
      <br>
      <h2 id="fade6start"> Quinn said administrators at the school “know some families make the choice to come to us, and they’re willing to take on that commute, so we want to make it the best experience we can.”</h2>

      <h2 id="fade9start">By December, at the end of the fall semester, India’s tardies had stacked up and her long commute was taking a toll. India’s grandmother Vanessa finally made the decision she had been considering for months: pulling India from Hardy midyear and switching her to a neighborhood school. “I decided to do it before [Hardy] could,” she said. </h2>
      <br>
      <p id="fade9end">It wasn’t an easy decision. India was happy at Hardy, she made the honor roll last year, and her best friend was there. India has attended six schools over the past seven years, and Vanessa was reluctant to uproot her again, especially in the middle of the year. But the drive added nearly three hours to India’s already long day. “She didn’t have any time to rest,” Vanessa said. “The commute just wasn’t worth it.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>Now, India’s grandmother drives her just five minutes to Kelly Miller Middle School, and India walks home with a friend at the end of the day, arriving by 4. “I’m glad we made the transition,” India said. “We all are.”</p>
