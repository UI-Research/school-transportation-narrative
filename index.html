India’s grandmother, Vanessa Hill, drives her from their home in northeast DC to Hardy Middle School in Georgetown, a trip that can sometimes take up to 1.5 hours.

      <p>When they pull up to Rose L. Hardy Middle School, the street isquiet. Just 30 minutesearlier, the block was bustling with students. India dashes out of the car, late once again for her first class.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Hardy is in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, DC, 10 miles from India’s home in Deanwood, in the northeast area of the city. During rush hour, driving from the eastern to the western edge of the city can take Vanessa and India between 45 minutesand 1.5 hours. DC doesn’t provide school buses (except for students with special needs), so many students commute by car or public transportation.</p>

      <div class="full-feature-text">
        <h2>India’s average commute is about 60 minutes. The average driving commute time of all sixth grade students in DC is 12.7 minutes.</h2>
        <h2>For all sixth grade students in ward 7, the municipal area where India lives, the average driving commute time is 18.0 minutes.</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Through the DC Public Schools lottery system, India got the chance to attend Hardy, a high-performing school outside the bounds of her neighborhood, even though it meant facing a long daily commute and being the only kid from her neighborhood at Hardy.</p>
      <br>
      <p>DC is one of many cities that have expanded school choice options in recent years,through policies such as inter-and intra-district choice, the growth of charter schools, and tax credit scholarships or vouchers for private schools.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In DC, all students can enter a lottery to go to the public school of their choice, regardless of whether it’s their neighborhood school. DC also hasa robust charter school system, along with a means-tested private-school voucher programfor low-income families.</p>
      <br>
      <p>But new choices can also mean trade-offs for families, and the school that best meets their needs might be on the other side of town.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Cities have tried to address this issue in different ways. DC gives students the DC One card through the Kids Ride Free program, which allows students in the District to travel to and from school for free. Other cities, like New Orleans and New York, offer yellow buses for certain age groups and school types.</p>

      <h2>Skyler Clay, a ninth grader at School Without Walls in the northwest DC neighborhood of Foggy Bottom, travels about 30 minutes on the public bus from her home in Columbia Heights. This is the 14-year-old’sfirst year at theprestigious magnet schoolafter testing in last year. </h2>

      <br>
      <p>While house hunting six years ago, Skyler’s mom, Sulee, knew she wanted to stay as close as possible to some of DC’s top schools, many of which are in northwest DC. Skyler and her 13-year-old brother, Preston, who attends Alice Deal Middle School in Friendship Heights, use the DC One card to get to and from school.</p>

        <p>Skyler’s mother, Sulee Clay, says goodbye to Skyler as she prepares to walk to the bus stop. Sulee rode the bus with Skyler the first time she took it to school, but now Skyler feels comfortable enough to do it alone.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Skyler leaves her house around 7:30 am every morning, walks down the block to the bus stop, and waits for the H1 bus. The H1 is crowded with professionals on their way to work and almost no other kids, but Skyler likes the quiet atmosphere. </p>

      <br>

      <p>Driving both kids to school would take over an hour, and Sulee has to drive an hour in the other direction to her office in Baltimore. She said some parents worry about their children taking the public bus, but for her, the benefits outweigh the risks. “It gives the kids a sense of pride and independence to be able to get around the city themselves,” she said. </p>
      <br>
      <p>It helps, of course, that Skyler is in high school. For elementary school students, riding the bus or Metro alone might not be the best option, even if it is the quickest way to school.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Amy Quinn, cofounder and director of teaching and learning at Washington Yu Ying Public Charter School in DC, said the elementary school works closely with students and families facing long commutes to try to make the start of their day less chaotic. “Besides just being late, commutes can cause stress that comes out in academics, because it comes out in behavior,” she said. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Some tactics to help students include providing breakfast in their first class and giving them a few minutes to settle in before jumping into schoolwork.</p> 
      <br>
      <h2>Quinn said administrators at the school “know some families make the choice to come to us, and they’re willing to take on that commute, so we want to make it the best experience we can.”</h2>

      <p>Transportation to school is more of a concern for black students, who consistently have longer commutes to school than white students in DC, as well as in Denver, Detroit, and New York. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Black students in DC, Denver, Detroit, New Orleans, and New York are also more likely than white students to be the only kid from their neighborhood attending their school. Leaving their home neighborhood could allow some students to escape higher-crime areas, but it could also mean that students and their parents feeling less connected to their peers. </p>

      <h2>By December, at the end of the fall semester, India’s tardies had stacked up and her long commute was taking a toll. India’s grandmother Vanessa finally made the decision she had been considering for months: pulling India from Hardy midyear and switching her to a neighborhood school. “I decided to do it before [Hardy] could,” she said. </h2>
      <br>
      <p>It wasn’t an easy decision. India was happy at Hardy, she made the honor roll last year, and her best friend was there. India has attended six schools over the past seven years, and Vanessa was reluctant to uproot her again, especially in the middle of the year. But the drive added nearly 3 hours to India’s already long day. “She didn’t have any time to rest,” Vanessa said. “The commute just wasn’t worth it.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>Now, India’s grandmother drives her just 5 minutes to Kelly Miller Middle School, and India walks home with a friend at the end of the day, arriving by 4 pm. “I’m glad we made the transition,” India said. “We all are.”</p>
      <br>
      <h2>“The learning environment will be different, but I know she’ll be able to adapt,” Vanessa said. “She’s always been good at adapting.”</h2>

      <h4>About the data</h4>

      <p class = "footerTopP">
        To calculate net present value of payments, we use a discount rate of 3 percent. We assume the borrower is employed every year and that her annual adjusted gross income increases 4 percent each year. We use the 2017 definition of the federal household poverty level for a single individual and inflate it 2 percent each year. We use a 4.45 percent student loan interest rate for all estimates, which is the current rate for direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans. For the PROSPER plan, we assume that the borrower makes $25 minimum payments (i.e., does not apply for financial hardship) and that payments are not inflated over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Federal student loan interest is compounded daily. We employ a daily compound interest formula to determine the standard 10-year monthly payment for the PAYE estimate and to calculate the full repayment of the loan under the PROSPER plan. But to simplify calculations for plan outcomes, we use annual compounding interest. REPAYE estimates are typically within $1,000 of estimates generated by the US Department of Education repayment estimator, and these estimates are more sensitive to changes in other assumptions (e.g., percentage income increases) than in the compounding period for interest.
