    <h1>Isn't that fantastic? Trees cover up a multitude of sins.</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="tagline"> Let that brush dance around there and play. Poor old tree. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>This is the way you take out your flustrations. Let your imagination be your guide. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Just use the old one inch brush.</p>
    <br>
    <a href="https://placeholder.com"><img src="http://via.placeholder.com/350x150"></a>
    <p>Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Let your heart be your guide. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now it's beginning to make a little sense. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Let the paint work. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Don't fiddle with it all day. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.</p>

      <h4>About the data</h4>

      <p class = "footerTopP">
        To calculate net present value of payments, we use a discount rate of 3 percent. We assume the borrower is employed every year and that her annual adjusted gross income increases 4 percent each year. We use the 2017 definition of the federal household poverty level for a single individual and inflate it 2 percent each year. We use a 4.45 percent student loan interest rate for all estimates, which is the current rate for direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans. For the PROSPER plan, we assume that the borrower makes $25 minimum payments (i.e., does not apply for financial hardship) and that payments are not inflated over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Federal student loan interest is compounded daily. We employ a daily compound interest formula to determine the standard 10-year monthly payment for the PAYE estimate and to calculate the full repayment of the loan under the PROSPER plan. But to simplify calculations for plan outcomes, we use annual compounding interest. REPAYE estimates are typically within $1,000 of estimates generated by the US Department of Education repayment estimator, and these estimates are more sensitive to changes in other assumptions (e.g., percentage income increases) than in the compounding period for interest.
